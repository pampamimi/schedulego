# ScheduLEGO 🐵⏰

Welcome to ScheduLEGO repository! A Whatsapp NodeJS bot for a P5 School project!

## What Is It ❓

**ScheduLEGO** is capable of doing some task that will change your life!.. *well, sort of..* but what it does is that it has a command where you can set a reminder, maybe you and your friend need to be reminded of a math exam in three days! don't worry, **ScheduLEGO** comes in clutch! just run the command and you'll be notified later on. and the rest of the feature is just reminds you what are tommorow's subject is going to be, and thats probably much it, i can't think of any more, feel free to suggest me a feature though.
